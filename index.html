        <p>There are moments in life… many moments where you will choose… consciously or unconsciously… life or death.</p>

               <blockquote><h2><em><strong> will choose if your dreams will die with you… or you will LIVE YOUR FULLEST POTENTIAL WHILE YOU ARE ALIVE.</strong></em></h2></blockquote>
                <p>There are moments that will define you. There are moments that will GROW YOU OR KILL YOU A LITTLE MORE DEEP IN YOUR SOUL.</p>
                
                <p>Sadly, not many people STAND UP to these moments. Most people cower and quit. If you’ve done that before. Make the decision NOW to NEVER ACCEPT IT AGAIN. You are more than that.</p>
                
                <h1><strong>What do those moments look like?</strong></h1>
                <p>It’s when you’ve been working on your dream for years…   You’re out of money…  Everyone close to you is telling you to give up… telling you to take the job… play it safe.   But you DIG DEEPER. You look at what you’ve done wrong… you LEARN MORE… you work HARDER… you FIND A DIFFERENT PATH… you SACRIFICE… you do whatever it takes to make that dream come to life…</p>
                
                <p>It’s when you’re in the gym… and your muscles are burning… you think you’ve only got ONE left… but you DIG DEEPER and discover you have 3, 4, 5.   That’s how muscle grows. When it’s PUSHED PAST THE PERCEIVED THE RESISTANCE. That is how you grow in LIFE!</p>
                
                <p>It’s when you’re on the field and you’re dead on your feet… you’ve already given EVERYTHING YOU HAVE INSIDE YOU… but someone gets past you… your team is relying on you.   You’re dead inside but you DIG DEEP and find some LIFE.</p>
                
                <p>You dig deep and find something that is not of this world. It’s from some place greater than you… and you make that tackle for your team.</p>
                
                <p>When you can walk off the field knowing you’ve given BEYOND EVERYTHING… that’s winning.</p>
                
                <p>You can win or lose the game… but you’ll never truly win inside your soul… unless you KNOW YOU’VE GIVEN EVERYTHING! The same is true in life.</p>
                
                <blockquote><h2><em><strong>Only YOU KNOW IF YOU’VE REALLY GIVEN YOUR ALL. Not just great effort until things went wrong. Not just working hard for a year before things got hard… so you quit and gave up on your dream.   I mean REALLY GIVING YOUR HEART AND SOUL!
                I MEAN WHEN YOU ARE DEAD ON YOUR FEET, WHEN YOU ARE BURIED BY ALL THE CRAP LIFE PILES ON YOU… BUT YOU DIG DEEPER AND FIND LIFE!!!</strong></em></h2></blockquote>
                
                <p> DIG DEEP IN YOUR SOUL and DISCOVER YOU GOT MORE!</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>YOU HAVE MORE INSIDE!</p>
                
                <p>ONE MORE REP!<br>
                ONE MORE LAP!<br>
                ONE MORE YEAR!<br>
                ONE MORE CALL!<br>
                ONE MORE COURSE!<br>
                ONE MORE BOOK!<br>
                YOU HAVE MORE!!!</p>
                
                <p>THERE IS LIFE INSIDE YOU THAT YOU HAVENT EVEN TOUCHED!!!<br>
                DIG DEEPER!!!</p>
                
                <blockquote><h2><em><strong></strong>Most people have conditioned themselves to take the easy option in life…</strong></em></h2></blockquote>
                <p>It doesn’t work out in your business… take the easy way out – take the job.</p>
                
                <p>Getting up early is too hard in winter… take the easy option… sleep in.</p>
                
                <p>You’ve failed… it’s not for you… take the easy option… quit.   NO! In those moments you discover your TRUE SELF.</p>
                
                <blockquote><h2><em><strong>It’s a cross road… and you choose RIGHT THEN the road to CHARACTER or the road to MISERY.</strong></em></h2></blockquote>
                <p>The road to GROWTH or the road to SUFFERING. The road to DEATH OR THE ROAD TO LIFE… BECAUSE YOU WILL DIE INSIDE IF YOU DONT DIG DEEP FOR THE LIFE YOU REALLY WANT.</p>
                
                <p>YOU SAY YOU HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING…<br>
                DIG DEEPER!<br>
                YOU FEEL LIKE THERE’S NOTHING LEFT INSIDE…<br>
                DIG DEEPER!!!<br>
                You’re getting OK results…<br>
                DIG DEEPER!<br>
                YOU MAY HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY…<br>
                DIG DEEPER!<br>
                You may have achieved a lot in your life…<br>
                DIG DEEPER!</p>
                
                <p>Life is GROWTH. Standing still is death.</p>
                
                <p>There IS life if you are willing to DIG DEEPER INSIDE YOURSELF!</p>
                
                <p><strong>Are you willing?</strong> </p>
                
                I don’t know about you but I will never want to pay the price it costs to QUIT.  The cost of giving up is too much for me to bare.   If you’re ordering EASY… I hope you enjoy the dessert… it’s the disgusting taste of REGRET.
                
                I’m ordering GROWTH every time. The option that enables CHARACTER. I suggest you do the same.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Deeper.</strong></p>
